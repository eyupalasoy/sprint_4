# Car Listings Data Analysis & Web App

## Project Description
This project analyzes a dataset of car listings to extract meaningful insights through Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and visualizations. The findings are then utilized to build a web application that helps users explore car market trends interactively.

## Running the App Locally
To run the web application locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```sh
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <repository-folder>
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies:**
   Ensure you have Python installed, then install the required packages:
   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Run the Application:**
   Execute the following command to start the app:
   ```sh
   python app.py
   ```
   The app should now be accessible at `http://127.0.0.1:5000/`.

## Dataset Overview
The dataset consists of various features, including model year, odometer readings, car make and model, cylinders, paint color, and whether the vehicle has 4WD. Missing data is carefully restored using contextual information, and EDA is performed to identify key trends.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
The Jupyter Notebook contains:
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Handling missing values
- Data visualizations using Seaborn and Matplotlib
- Key insights and trends in car listings
